# CulturalGoals: AI-Powered Goal Setting with Cultural Intelligence

*🏆 Qloo LLM Hackathon Submission*

##Note - This REPO is only the QLOO functionality. The Prod app is proprietary, and the ios, android, web and other functionality remains private repo

## 🎯 What We Built

**CulturalGoals** transforms generic goal-setting into culturally-intelligent, personally meaningful experiences by integrating Qloo's Taste AI™ with advanced LLMs. Instead of creating one-size-fits-all productivity systems, we generate goals and project frameworks that align with users' cultural preferences, interests, and lifestyle choices.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional goal-setting apps fail because they ignore the human element—our cultural identity, personal tastes, and what actually motivates us. A fitness goal that suggests generic gyms to someone who loves indie music and specialty coffee is less likely to succeed than one that recommends boutique studios with curated playlists and post-workout artisan coffee spots.

### Our Solution

We've built three core AI-powered features that use Qloo's cultural intelligence to enhance goal achievement:

## 🎨 Core Features

### 1. **Cultural Goal Architect**
*Transforms generic goals into culturally-aligned, personally meaningful objectives*

**How it works:**
- Analyzes user's cultural preferences (music, food, lifestyle, brands)
- Maps goal requirements to culturally-aligned approaches
- Suggests goal strategies that feel authentic and engaging

**Example:**
```
Input: "I want to get healthier"
User Profile: Indie music lover, specialty coffee enthusiast, urban professional

Enhanced Goal:
- Boutique fitness studios that play curated indie playlists
- Health-focused cafes serving specialty coffee for post-workout rewards  
- Urban hiking groups that meet at indie venues
- Mindfulness apps with aesthetics matching indie culture
- Community fitness events in arts districts
```

### 2. **Smart Project Component Generator**
*Creates culturally-aware project components with personalized recommendations*

**Generated Components:**
- **Venues**: Locations that match the user's taste profile
- **Content**: Books, podcasts, videos aligned with their interests
- **Tools**: Brands and services that resonate culturally
- **Communities**: Networking opportunities in their cultural sphere

**Example:**
```
Project: "Launch Local Business" 
User Profile: Craft beer enthusiast, sustainability-focused, tech background

Generated Components:
- Venues: Co-working spaces popular with craft beer entrepreneurs
- Content: Business books emphasizing environmental sustainability
- Tools: Brands favored by eco-conscious tech startups
- Communities: Local craft beer entrepreneur meetups
```

### 3. **Cross-Domain Discovery Engine**
*Finds unexpected connections between interests and goals for innovative approaches*

**Discovers:**
- Surprising cultural connections between user interests and goal domains
- Bridge opportunities between different cultural spheres
- Trending crossover opportunities
- Innovation insights based on cultural affinities

**Example:**
```
User Interests: Japanese cuisine, minimalist design, vinyl records
Target Domain: Starting a business

Discoveries:
- Japanese cuisine enthusiasts show strong affinity for minimalist business aesthetics
- Vinyl record collectors gravitate toward artisanal/craft business models
- Innovation opportunity: Minimalist design consultancy for restaurants
- Cultural bridge: Combine aesthetic principles from Japanese design with artisanal food businesses
```
